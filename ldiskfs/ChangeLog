Severity   : normal
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 12415
Description: Updated patchess for new RHEL4 kernel
Details    : Add patch ext3-unlink-race.patch
	     Updated series file ldiskfs-2.6-rhel4.series

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 6334
Description: Multiple mount protection(MMP) support.
Details    : This feature will protect the filesystem from being mounted more
	     than once simultaneously. It will also protect changes by e2fsprogs
	     to the filesystem if it is mounted. This assumes high importance
	     in a shared storage environment where multiple mounts can severely
	     corrupt the filesystem.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 10657
Description: Add journal checksum support. (ext3 part)
Details    : The journal checksum feature adds two new flags i.e 
             JBD2_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_ASYNC_COMMIT and 
	     JBD2_FEATURE_COMPAT_CHECKSUM. JBD2_FEATURE_CHECKSUM flag
   	     indicates that the commit block contains the checksum for
    	     the blocks described by the descriptor blocks. Now commit
      	     record can be sent to disk without waiting for descriptor
    	     blocks to be written to disk. This behavior is controlled
     	     using JBD2_FEATURE_ASYNC_COMMIT flag.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10555
Description: Add a FIEMAP(FIle Extent MAP) ioctl for ldiskfs
Details    : FIEMAP ioctl will allow an application to efficiently fetch the
             extent information of a file. It can be used to map logical blocks
             in a file to physical blocks in the block device.

Description: Add journal checksum support. (ext3 part)
Details    : The journal checksum feature adds two new flags i.e 
             JBD2_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_ASYNC_COMMIT and 
	     JBD2_FEATURE_COMPAT_CHECKSUM. JBD2_FEATURE_CHECKSUM flag
   	     indicates that the commit block contains the checksum for
    	     the blocks described by the descriptor blocks. Now commit
      	     record can be sent to disk without waiting for descriptor
    	     blocks to be written to disk. This behavior is controlled
     	     using JBD2_FEATURE_ASYNC_COMMIT flag.

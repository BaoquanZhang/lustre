Description: Multiple mount protection(MMP) support.
Details    : This feature will protect the filesystem from being mounted more
	     than once simultaneously. It will also protect changes by e2fsprogs
	     to the filesystem if it is mounted. This assumes high importance
	     in a shared storage environment where multiple mounts can severely
	     corrupt the filesystem.

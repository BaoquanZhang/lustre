This script is to be used to test the performance of the
individual OSTs in a Lustre filesystem.

Goal: 
	- Generate a fixed amount of IO per OST
	- Identify the fastest and slowest OST
	
Parameters
	- Size of per-OST IO

Plan

	Identify number of OSTs in system
	For each OST
	- create a directory
	- use lfs setstripe to restrict IO to that directory
	- run some form of IO 
	
Assumptions
	- Lustre filesystem is up and running
	- Script is being run on a client


Steps

	0. Check pre-requisites
		- sgp_dd
	1. Identify the number of OSTs in the system
		- store value

	2. Collect input parameters
		- store value

	3. Set up array to hold output
	
	4. Loop over all OSTs
		- Create a directory
		- Set striping on that directory
		- Run some IO and time
		- Resolve MB/s
		- Store in array

	5. Determine max an min for the array

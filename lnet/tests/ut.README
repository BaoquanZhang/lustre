The utcli (unit test client) and utsrv (unit test server) are very simple
unit test tools, for sending and receiving single get's/put's of a specific 
size, using the LNET API set.

Test Setup
uml1 ip=192.168.2.1
uml2 ip=192.168.2.2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Test #1 - small get operation

1) Setup server for listening
uml2 $ insmod utsvr.ko   

2) Do the get operation NID must be specified but all other are default
paramters which causes a 300 byte get op
uml1 $ insmod utcli.ko nid=192.168.2.2@tcp

3) Unload the utsvr because currently it only supports a single operation
buffers are not reposted after they are consumed
*** FIX THIS LIMITATION ***
uml2 $ rmmod utsvr

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Test #2 - small put operation
(The setup and cleanup of the server are left out, because they are the
same as above)

1) The adition of the "put=1" paramter causes a put rather than a get.  The
default size of 300 is still used.
uml1 $ insmod utcli.ko nid=192.168.2.2@tcp put=1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Test #3 - large get operation

1) Setup server for listening.  The size must be specified on the server or else
the default of 300 bytes will be used.
uml2 $ insmod utsvr.ko  pkt_size=5000 

2) Do the large get operation pkt_size=5000.  put=0 is a get operation, 
it is equivlenet to just not having that parameter.
uml1 $ insmod utcli.ko nid=192.168.2.2@tcp put=0 pkt_size=5000

scimacnal - A NAL for the Scali ScaMAC midlayer.

The ScaMAC midlayer is a simplified API to the SCI high performance
interconnect.

In order to use this NAL you'll need to tune scimac to use larger buffers.
See scimac.conf in this directory for an example.

Overall performance and stability isn't great but this can be attributed
to the scimac driver which apparently is in need of some development.

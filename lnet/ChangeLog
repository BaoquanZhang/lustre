Severity   : minor

             clear a lazy portal.

Bugzilla   : 11680
Description: make panic on lbug configurable

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 12316
Description: Add OFED1.2 support to o2iblnd
Details    : o2iblnd depends on OFED's modules, if out-tree OFED's modules
             are installed (other than kernel's in-tree infiniband), there
             could be some problem while insmod o2iblnd (mismatch CRC of 
             ib_* symbols).
             If extra Module.symvers is supported in kernel (i.e, 2.6.17),
             this link provides solution:
             https://bugs.openfabrics.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355
             if extra Module.symvers is not supported in kernel, we will
             have to run the script in bug 12316 to update
             $LINUX/module.symvers before building o2iblnd.
             More details about this are in bug 12316.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Description: Ptllnd didn't init kptllnd_data.kptl_idle_txs before it could be
	     possibly accessed in kptllnd_shutdown. Ptllnd should init

Bugzilla   : 11659
Description: Credit overflows
Details    : This was a bug in ptllnd connection establishment.  The fix
             implements better peer stamps to disambiguate connection
	     establishment and ensure both peers enter the credit flow
	     state machine consistently.

Bugzilla   : 11394
Description: kptllnd didn't propagate some network errors up to LNET 
Details    : This bug was spotted while investigating 11394.  The fix
             ensures network errors on sends and bulk transfers are
	     propagated to LNET/lustre correctly.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10316
Description: Fixed console chatter in case of -ETIMEDOUT.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11684
Description: Added D_NETTRACE for recording network packet history
	     (initially only for ptllnd).  Also a separate userspace
	     ptllnd facility to gather history which should really be
	     covered by D_NETTRACE too, if only CDEBUG recorded history in
	     userspace.

Bugzilla   : 11616
Description: o2iblnd handle early RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED.
Details    : If the fabric is lossy, an RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED
	     callback can occur before a connection has actually been
	     established.  This caused an assertion failure previously.

Severity   : enhancement

	     multiple HCAs and routing between them.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 11201
Description: lnet deadlock in router_checker
Details    : turned ksnd_connd_lock, ksnd_reaper_lock, and ksock_net_t:ksnd_lock
	     into BH locks to eliminate potential deadlock caused by
	     ksocknal_data_ready() preempting code holding these locks.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 11126
Description: Millions of failed socklnd connection attempts cause a very slow FS
Details    : added a new route flag ksnr_scheduled to distinguish from
	     ksnr_connecting, so that a peer connection request is only turned
	     down for race concerns when an active connection to the same peer
	     is under progress (instead of just being scheduled).

Severity   : major on XT3
Bugzilla   : none
Description: libcfs overwrites /proc/sys/portals
Details    : libcfs created a symlink from /proc/sys/portals to
	     /proc/sys/lnet for backwards compatibility.  This is no
	     longer required and makes the Cray portals /proc variables
	     inaccessible.

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 11312
Description: OFED FMR API change
Details    : This changes parameter usage to reflect a change in
	     ib_fmr_pool_map_phys() between OFED 1.0 and OFED 1.1.  Note
	     that FMR support is only used in experimental versions of the
	     o2iblnd - this change does not affect standard usage at all.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11245
Description: new ko2iblnd module parameter: ib_mtu
Details    : the default IB MTU of 2048 performs badly on 23108 Tavor
	     HCAs.  You can avoid this problem by setting the MTU to 1024
	     using this module parameter.

Bugzilla   : 11118/11620
Description: ptllnd small request message buffer alignment fix
Details    : Set the PTL_MD_LOCAL_ALIGN8 option on small message receives.
	     Round up small message size on sends in case this option
	     is not supported.  11620 was a defect in the initial
	     implementation which effectively asserted all peers had to be
	     running the correct protocol version which was fixed by always
	     NAK-ing such requests and handling any misalignments they
	     introduce.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rarely
Description: When kib(nal|lnd)_del_peer() is called upon a peer whose

Description: If ksocknal_lib_setup_sock() fails, a ref on peer is lost.
	     If connd connects a route which has been closed by
	     ksocknal_shutdown(), ksocknal_create_routes() may create new
	     routes which hold references on the peer, causing shutdown
	     process to wait for peer to disappear forever.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11234
Description: Dump XT3 portals traces on kptllnd timeout
Details    : Set the kptllnd module parameter "ptltrace_on_timeout=1" to
	     dump Cray portals debug traces to a file.  The kptllnd module
	     parameter "ptltrace_basename", default "/tmp/lnet-ptltrace",

Bugzilla   : 11308
Description: kernel ptllnd fix bug in connection re-establishment
Details    : Kernel ptllnd could produce protocol errors e.g. illegal

2005-10-10  Cluster File Systems, Inc. <info@clusterfs.com>
	* Configuration change for the XT3
	     The PTLLND is now used to run Lustre over Portals on the XT3.
	     The configure option(s) --with-cray-portals are no longer
	     used.  Rather --with-portals=<path-to-portals-includes> is
	     used to enable building on the XT3.  In addition to enable
	     XT3 specific features the option --enable-cray-xt3 must be
	     used.

2005-10-10  Cluster File Systems, Inc. <info@clusterfs.com>
	* Portals has been removed, replaced by LNET.
	   LNET is new networking infrastructure for Lustre, it includes a
	   reorganized network configuration mode (see the user
	   documentation for full details) as well as support for routing
	   between different network fabrics.  Lustre Networking Devices
	   (LNDS) for the supported network fabrics have also been created
	   for this new infrastructure.

	  - removed CFS_DECL_SPIN* 
	    just use 'spinlock_t' and initialise with spin_lock_init()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_MUTEX*
	    just use 'struct semaphore' and initialise with init_mutex()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_RWSEM*
	    just use 'struct rw_semaphore' and initialise with init_rwsem()

	  - renamed cfs_sleep_chan -> cfs_waitq
	            cfs_sleep_link -> cfs_waitlink

          - fixed race in linux version of arch-independent socknal
  	    (the ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision).

	  - Didn't fix problems in Darwin version of arch-independent socknal
 	    (resetting socket callbacks, eager ack hack, ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision)

	  - removed libcfs types from non-socknal header files (only some types
	    in the header files had been changed; the .c files hadn't been
	    updated at all).

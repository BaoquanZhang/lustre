	- Better console error messages if 'ip2nets' can't match an IP address
	- Fixed overflow/use-before-set bugs in linux-time.h
	- Fixed ptllnd bug that wasn't initialising rx descriptors completely
	- LNET teardown failed an assertion about the route table being empty
	- Fixed a crash in LNetEQPoll(<invalid handle>)

	* Configuration change for the XT3
	     The PTLLND is now used to run Lustre over Portals on the XT3.
	     The configure option(s) --with-cray-portals are no longer
	     used.  Rather --with-portals=<path-to-portals-includes> is
	     used to enable building on the XT3.  In addition to enable
	     XT3 specific features the option --enable-cray-xt3 must be
	     used.

	* Portals has been removed, replaced by LNET.
	   LNET is new networking infrastructure for Lustre, it includes a
	   reorganized network configuration mode (see the user
	   documentation for full details) as well as support for routing
	   between different network fabrics.  Lustre Networking Devices
	   (LNDS) for the supported network fabrics have also been created
	   for this new infrastructure.

       * version 1.4.4
       * bug fixes

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare (large Voltaire clusters only)
Bugzilla   : 6993
Description: the default number of reserved transmit descriptors was too low
	     for some large clusters
Details    : As a workaround, the number was increased.  A proper fix includes
	     a run-time tunable.

2005-06-02  Cluster File Systems, Inc. <info@clusterfs.com>
       * version 1.4.3
       * bug fixes

Severity   : major
Frequency  : occasional (large-scale events, cluster reboot, network failure)
Bugzilla   : 6411
Description: too many error messages on console obscure actual problem and
	     can slow down/panic server, or cause recovery to fail repeatedly
Details    : enable rate-limiting of console error messages, and some messages
	     that were console errors now only go to the kernel log

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 1693
Description: add /proc/sys/portals/catastrophe entry which will report if
	     that node has previously LBUGged

2005-02-04  Eric Barton  <eeb@bartonsoftware.com>

	* Landed portals:b_port_step as follows...

	  - removed CFS_DECL_SPIN* 
	    just use 'spinlock_t' and initialise with spin_lock_init()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_MUTEX*
	    just use 'struct semaphore' and initialise with init_mutex()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_RWSEM*
	    just use 'struct rw_semaphore' and initialise with init_rwsem()

	  - renamed cfs_sleep_chan -> cfs_waitq
	            cfs_sleep_link -> cfs_waitlink

          - fixed race in linux version of arch-independent socknal
  	    (the ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision).

	  - Didn't fix problems in Darwin version of arch-independent socknal
 	    (resetting socket callbacks, eager ack hack, ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision)

	  - removed libcfs types from non-socknal header files (only some types
	    in the header files had been changed; the .c files hadn't been
	    updated at all).

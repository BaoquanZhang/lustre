       * bug fixes:
         - #1592 fixes trying to read a single page that was entirely past
           EOF, we would later oops in commitrw on the OST trying to dput
           a NULL dentry.  This fixes the 'make' issue Richard discovered.
         - #1765 fixes MDS cleanup bug where we have an outstanding reply
           at disconnect time.  Remove all exp_outstanding_reply
           manipulation in mds_disconnect.
         - #1732 fixes the lprocfs unresolved symbol error.
         - #1763 fixes timestamps on files getting advanced incorrectly.
         - #1639 client VFS truncate/write lock inversion.  This caused
           the bug in Joe Koning music code.

       * version llnl_5devel tagged
       * bug fixes:
         - #1600 MDS server data isn't written at setup.  This causes a crash 
           in mds_update_server_data when the MDS is mounted the first time.
         - #1749 
           - avoids setting DISP_LOOKUP_EXECD until we can set either 
             LOOKUP_NEG or LOOKUP_POS.
           - backports a fix from b_devel, to return LOCK_ABORTED if 
             LOOKUP_EXECD isn't set.
         - #1642
           - backport some small cleanups to the dentry refcounts and cleanup
           - Zach's fix from llpio which fixes a race condition in the 
             partial read
path

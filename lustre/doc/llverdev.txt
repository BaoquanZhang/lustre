BLOCK DEVICE VERIFICATION TOOL. ( bdevt )
==========================================

Building tool: 
	To build this tool you just need to invoke make at command prompt.
	e.g.  $ make 
	
	this will compile the sources and build bdevt in this directory.

Usage: 
Syntax:

./bdevt [OPTION]... <device-name> ... 

[OPTION]
        -t {seconds} for --timestamp,  set test time (default=current time())
        -o {offset}  for --offset, offset in kB of start of test (default=0)
        -r run test in read (verify) mode
        -w run test in write (test-pattern) mode (default=r&w)
        -v for verbose
        -p for --partial, for partial check (1GB steps)
        -l for --long, full check (default 4k)
        -c for --chunksize, IO chunk size (default=1048576)
        -f for --force, force test to run without confirmation
	--help to display help.

Guide lines for using this tool:
	It is expected that bdevt tool will be run on large size devices (TB), 
So it is always better to run bdevt tool in verbose mode, So that one can easily 
restart device testing from the point at which it had stoped. 
for example:

	[root@tucker bdevt]# ./bdevt -v -f -w --timestamp=1009839028 /dev/hda5
	Number of sectors: 49158837, this makes 23.441 GB
	Timestamp: 1009839028
	Current write offset:        5078016 kB

If due to some reason sombody breaks execution at this point then one can 
easily restart device from the same point by picking the same offset 
displayed in by verbose as explained below.

	[root@tucker bdevt]# ./bdevt -v -f -w --offset=5078016 --timestamp=1009839028 /dev/hda5
	Number of sectors: 49158837, this makes 23.441 GB
	Timestamp: 1009839028
	Current write offset:        9726208 kB
 
One can use similar things for read only and read write modes also.

.TH Lustre 7 "2006 Jun 15" Lustre "A high-performance cluster file system"
.SH NAME
Lustre
.SH SYNOPSIS
A high-performance file system designed for clusters.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B LustreÂ®
is a high-performance, massively-scalable, POSIX-compliant network file system
designed for the world's largest high-performance compute clusters. Lustre
is under active development from Cluster FileSystems (http://clusterfs.com).

Lustre filesystems are made up of multiple servers typically distributed
across multiple nodes.  Lustre clients can contact these server nodes over
multiple high-speed network fabrics via LNET, the Lustre NETworking
system.  Clients then present the filesystem at a mount point.

A filesystem is comprised of a 
.I MDT
, MetaData Target, which stores directory and file meta-information, and a
series of 
.I OSTs
, Object Storage Targets, which hold the file data.  There is typically not
a 1:1 mapping of a file on disk and what is presented as a file on a Lustre client.

Lustre and LNET are implemented as a series of kernel modules, for both
servers and clients. LNET networks are defined in the modprobe.conf file on
all nodes.  Lustre and LNET make extensive use of /proc files for making
system data available, for example
.TP
.B /proc/sys/lnet/nis
to show the local LNET Network Interfaces.
.TP
.B /proc/fs/lustre/devices
to show locally running Lustre objects.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B mkfs.lustre(8)
Format a physical disk for use as a Lustre server's backend storage (aka
target).
.TP
.B tunefs.lustre(8)
Modify configuration information on a Lustre target disk.
.TP
.B mount.lustre(8)
A helper program for
.BR mount (8)
that starts Lustre servers and clients.
.TP
.B lctl(8)
A low-level interface to control various aspects of Lustre
.TP
.B lfs(1)
A user-level interface to control Lustre-specific information for
individual files. 
.B lustre_config
Format multiple Lustre targets simultaneously from definitions in a CSV
file.

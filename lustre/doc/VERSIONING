Lustre versioning
=================

0.0.1  2/19/2002 <braam@clusterfs.com>
0.0.2  3/14/2002 <braam@clusterfs.com> describe branches / stable tag

This document describes versioning of source and binaries for Lustre.

CVS
===

Versions will have 4 digits:
                     major.minor.patch.test

Such versions will be tagged in CVS as:  
                     v1_2_11_7
and referred to as:
                     1.2.11.7
encoded as:
                     0x01021107

Usage: 
------

New numbers are used as follows: 

1. major: 
 - increased when major new functionality becomes available
2. minor: 
 - even: for each new release with new functionality
 - odd : when a new development cycle starts after a release
3. patch:
 - when a development snapshot or release update becomes available
 - all these are announced on lustre-devel@lists.sf.net
4. test: 
 - when developers feel it is time to exchange a named version

What will run, what won't ? 
---------------------------

1. If the test level is non-zero no guarantees of any kind are made. 

2. For three digit releases/tags the code should perform 
   according to the announcement.

Moving tags
-----------

The last stable release will be tagged:            CVS tag "stable"
The last operational development snapshot will be  CVS tag "dstable"

Branches
--------

For even minor releases a branch tag will be created.  The branch tag
will be of the form: 

bmajor_minor

Note that the CVS head is where development is going.  If developers
use a branch they must eventually merge that back into the head.
Typically this is done by importing changes into the branch and
removing the sticky tags:

cvs update -A

fixing any conflicts and then committing.

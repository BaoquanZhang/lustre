Lustre versioning
=================

0.0.1  2/19/2002 <braam@clusterfs.com>

This document describes versioning of source and binaries for Lustre.

CVS
===

Versions will have 4 digits:
                     major.minor.patch.test

Such versions will be tagged in CVS as:  
                     v1_2_11_7
and referred to as:
                     1.2.11.7
encoded as:
                     0x01021107

Usage: 
------

New numbers are used as follows: 

1. major: 
 - increased when major new functionality becomes available
2. minor: 
 - even: for each new release with new functionality
 - odd : when a new development cycle starts after a release
3. patch:
 - when a development snapshot or release update becomes available
 - all these are announced on lustre-devel@lists.sf.net
4. test: 
 - when developers feel it is time to exchange a named version

What will run, what won't:

1. If the test level is non-zero no guarantees of any kind are made. 
2. For three digit releases/tags the code should perform 
   according to the announcement.

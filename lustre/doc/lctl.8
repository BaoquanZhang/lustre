.SH NAME
lctl \- Low level Lustre filesystem configuration utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B lctl
.br
.B lctl --device <devno> <command [args]>
.br
.B lctl --threads <numthreads> <verbose> <devno> <command [args]>
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lctl
can be invoked in interactive mode by issuing lctl command. After that, commands are issued as below. The most common commands in lctl are (in matching pairs) 
.B device 
and 
.B attach
, 
.B detach 
and 
.B setup
,
.B cleanup 
and
.B connect
,
.B disconnect 
and
.B help
, and
.B quit.

To get a complete listing of available commands, type help at the lctl prompt.  To get basic help on the meaning and syntax of a command, type help command.  Command completion is activated with the TAB key, and command history is available via the up- and down-arrow keys. 

For non-interactive single-threaded use, one uses the second invocation, which runs command after connecting to the device. 

.B Network Configuration
.TP 
network <tcp/elans/myrinet> 
Indicate what kind of network applies for the configuration commands that follow.
.TP 
connect [[<hostname> <port>] | <elan id>] 
This will establish a connection to a remote network network id given by the hostname/port combination, or the elan id.
.TP 
disconnect <nid> 
Disconnect from a remote nid.
.TP 
mynid [nid] 
Informs the socknal of the local nid. It defaults to hostname for tcp networks and is automatically setup for elan/myrinet networks.
.TP 
add_uuid <uuid> <nid> 
Associate a given UUID with an nid.
.TP 
close_uuid <uuid> 
Disconnect a UUID.
.TP 
del_uuid <uuid> 
Delete a UUID association.
.TP 
add_route <gateway> <target> [target] 
Add an entry to the routing table for the given target.
.TP 
del_route <target> 
Delete an entry for the target from the routing table.
.TP 
route_list 
Print the complete routing table.
.TP 
recv_mem [size] 
Set the socket receive buffer size; if the size is omitted, the default size for the buffer is printed.
.TP 
send_mem [size] 
Set send buffer size for the socket; if size is omitted, the default size for the buffer is printed.
.TP 
nagle [on/off] 
Enable/disable nagle; omitting the argument will cause the default value to be printed.
.TP 
fail nid|all [count] 
Fail/restore communications. Ommiting tha count implies fail indefinitely, count of zero indicates that communication should be restored. A non-zero count indicates the number of portals messages to be dropped after which the communication is restored.
.PP
.B Device Selection
.TP 
newdev 
Create a new device.
.TP 
name2dev 
This command can be used to determine a device number for the given device name.
.TP 
device 
This will select the specified OBD device.  All other commands depend on the device being set. 
.TP 
device_list 
Show all the devices.
.TP 
lustre_build_version 
Print the Lustre build version.
.PP
.B Device Configuration
.TP 
attach type [name [uuid]] 
Attach a type to the current device (which you need to set using the device command) and give that device a name and UUID.  This allows us to identify the device for use later, and also tells us what type of device we will have.
.TP 
setup <args...> 
Type specific device setup commands. For obdfilter, a setup command tells the driver which block device it should use for storage and what type of filesystem is on that device. 
.TP 
cleanup 
Cleanup a previously setup device.
.TP 
detach 
Remove driver (and name and UUID) from the current device.
.TP 
lov_setconfig lov-uuid stripe-count default-stripe-size offset pattern UUID1 [UUID2...] 
Write LOV configuration to an MDS device.
.TP 
lov_getconfig lov-uuid 
Read LOV configuration from an MDS device. Returns default-stripe-count, default-stripe-size, offset, pattern, and a list of OST UUID's.
.PP
.B Device Operations
.TP 
probe [timeout] 
Build a connection handle to a device. This command is used to suspend configuration until the lctl command has ensured that the MDS and OSC services are available. This is to avoid mount failures in a rebooting cluster.
.TP 
close 
Close the connection handle
.TP 
getattr <objid> 
Get attributes for an OST object <objid> .
.TP 
setattr <objid> <mode> 
Set mode attribute for OST object <objid>.
.TP 
create [num [mode [verbose]]] 
Create the specified number <num> of OST objects with the given <mode>.
.TP 
destroy <num> 
Starting at <objid>, destroy <num> number of objects starting from the object with object id <objid>.
.TP 
test_getattr <num> [verbose [[t]objid]] 
Do <num> getattrs on OST object <objid> (objectid+1 on each thread).
.TP 
test_brw [t]<num> [write [verbose [npages [[t]objid]]]] 
Do <num> bulk read/writes on OST object <objid> (<npages> per I/O).
.TP 
test_ldlm 
Perform lock manager test.
.TP 
ldlm_regress_start %s [numthreads [refheld [numres [numext]]]] 
Start lock manager stress test.
.TP 
ldlm_regress_stop 
Stop lock manager stress test.
.TP 
dump_ldlm 
Dump all lock manager state, this is very useful for debugging
.TP 
activate

De-activate an import
.TP 
recover <connection UUID> 
.TP 
lookup <directory> <file>
.TP

Disable sending of committed transnumber updates
.TP 
readonly 
Disable writes to the underlying device
.TP 
abort_recovery 
Abort recovery on MDS device
.TP 
mount_option

.TP 
get_stripe

.TP 
unset_stripe <objid>

.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be used to invoke lctl. 
.TP
.B --device 
The device number to be used for the operation. The value of devno is an integer, normally found by calling lctl name2dev on a device name. 
.TP
.B --threads 
How many threads should be forked doing the command specified. The numthreads variable is a strictly positive integer indicating how many threads should be started. The devno option is used as above.
.TP
.B --ignore_errors | ignore_errors 
Ignore errors during script processing
.TP
.B dump 
Save ioctls to a file

Instructions for building, configuring and running Lustre can be found in
the file doc/lustre-HOWTO.txt.

If you have checked lustre directly out of CVS, then you either need to
get lyx to build the lustre-HOWTO.txt from the source file, get the PDF
version from the lustre.org website, or install the lustre-doc RPM for
the formatted text version (or read the somewhat cryptic lustre-HOWTO.lin
file if you are desperate).

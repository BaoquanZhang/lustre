       * version llnl_0proda tagged
       * bug fixes:
         - #1642
           - backport some small cleanups to the dentry refcounts and cleanup
           - Zach's fix from llpio which fixes a race condition in the
             partial read
         - #1592 fixes trying to read a single page that was entirely past
           EOF, we would later oops in commitrw on the OST trying to dput
           a NULL dentry.  This fixes the 'make' issue Richard discovered.
         - #1505 patch to quiet four messages
           - "lustre_commitd quitting"
           - "processing error -107" after server is restarted
           - no need to print statfs() errors to the console
           - print one reconnect message instead of two
         - Adjusted version_tag.pl to use portals version string if no
           /CVS/Tag exists.  This resolves rpms using only the HEAD tag.

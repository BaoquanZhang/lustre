	 - Fully reactivate OST imports after reconnection (512, others)
	 - Make sure client sees our -ENOTCONN from mds_handle (513 - partial)
	 - More graceful error handling for truncating on dead OST (515)
	 - Don't error out unless we're actually accessing dead stripes (474)
	 - Fix garbage sizes when stripes are missing (410)
	 - LRU counters were broken, causing constant lock purge (433, 432)
	 - garbage on read from stripes with failed OSTs (441)
	 - mark OSCs as active before reconnecting during recovery (438)
	 - lov_enqueue and lov_cancel need to handle inactive OSTs (403)
	 - lfind did not preserve OST order in output (443)
	 - symlinks cause hung clients, incorrect data (439)
	 - stop dereferencing request after dropping refcount (457)
	 - don't LASSERT(spin_is_locked) on non-SMP (455)
	 - fixes for many rename() bugs
	 - fstat didn't correctly synchronize attributes (399)
	 - server must handle lock cancellation during blocking AST prep (487)
	 - bulk descriptors were free()d too soon (511)
	 - fix paths in lconf, which would load incorrect modules (451, 507)
	 - fix confusing lconf 'host not found' error message (386)
	 - fix lock order deadlock on OST (O/R i_sem before journal ops, 478)
	 - fix race condition in mdc_blocking_ast() for inode access (526)
	 - fix lov_unpackmd() unpacking wrong number of stripes (537)

	 - call mds_fs_cleanup before unmounting filesystem (524)
	 - fix races between taking ns_lock and ldlm_lock_change_resource
	 - fix races updating LOV export open file list
	 - fix lov_enqueue error path, avoid decref-ing bad lock handle
	 - fix recovery NULL deref in ldlm_cli_cancel_unused
	 - fix some DLM races by using new hash table for lock handles (419)
	 - permit the client to specify desired inodes, at replay
	 - duplicate requests when we queue them for replay reintegration
	 - fix last_rcvd offset calculation
	 - sync after each recovered transaction, so we always make progress
	 - never, not always, ERESTART requests without transnos
	 - store the lov_desc in the MDS, so we don't depend on getlovinfo to
	   set it
	 - skip replay if the MDS says that the client is already connected
	 - don't check for a recovery-enabled export to match lctl's UUID
	 - don't INC_USE_COUNT for phantom exports
	 - don't crash when cleaning up phantom exports (567)
	 - don't double-finish or set replay data for errored mdc_open requests
	 - abort requests when they time out, so we don't get old replies
	 - send/receive replies for AST messages again
	 - if the client says that it doesn't have the lock, cancel it on the
	   server
	 - if we timeout during I/O, don't try to cancel an in-use lock; instead
	   mark it as destroyed, it will all work out when decref is called
	 - fix module use counts (22, 581)
	* protocol changes
	 - ASTs now expect a reply (server cancels lock on error reply)

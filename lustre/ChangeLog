	* obdfs/flushd.c: conditionalized number of C_DEBUG messages.
	* include/linux/obd_class.h: added obd_devicename member to 
	  struct obd_device (name is either ptr to dentry or uuid).
	* ext2obd/ext2_obd.c: setup() converts dentry into rdev number.
	  class/class_obd.c: setup() converts name into obd_device dentry
	  class/obdcontrol: setup() passes /dev/obd name into ioctl
	  (used to be rdev number and if invalid rdev number was passed
	   old ext2_obd.c would crash kernel when trying to read superblock).
	* class/obdcontrol: added "status, procsys, script, insmod, rmmod,
	  lsmod, shell and close" commands for obdcontrol. This allows
	  easier scripting from within obdcontrol. Introduced ability to
	  maintain multiple open obd devices from a single obdcontrol
	  session.  Device command toggles device context. Obdcontrol
	  maintains multiple open file handles. "script <file>" command is
	  useful for "sourcing" scripts without leaving obdcontrol.
	  shell <command> allows any shell command to be executed from
	  within obdcontrol.
	* class/proc_lustre.c: added support for /proc/lustre/obd/<n>/status.
	  These are read-only /proc entries that track /dev/obd<n> 
	  internal state. 
        * obdtrace/* & include/linux/obd_class.h: obd_trace a logical obd
	  module useful for tracing and performance debug of the Lustre
	  obd protocol stack. obdtrace module creates
	  /proc/lustre/obd/<n>/stats file. Reading this /proc file shows
	  per OBD performance statistics.  Any write to this /proc file
	  resets the counters for this OBD. 
	* scripts/obdtrace_demo.scr: Example of obdtrace that
	  takes advantage of new obdcontrol functionality.
        * doc/obdtrace_demo.txt: shows obdtrace capabilities.

2000-01-26 01:40 adilger

	* obdfs/flushd.c: removed iput() from dequeue routine, since we no

	* include/obd_support.h: removed printk() of long long values
	  (sometimes does not print properly)
	* obdfs/rw.c: added obdo_from_inode() call in obdfs_brw(), as inode
	  was not properly being copied into obdo, causing occasional confusion
	* snap/snap.c: always copy back obdo data to primary from disk obdo
	* obdsync/*: removed from CVS

1999-10-28    <braam@wolf.rockies.stelias.com>

	* INOFS: a new "inode" file system was written.  It tests components
 	of obdfs and could be useful for Coda/AFS servers and object
 	databases.

	* This file system will not have directories, but access pure
 	objects. Readdir will be an iterator and to create objects with
 	known names (integers of course) the preallocation function will
 	need to be completed.
	
	* This will still need to exploit preallocation and and a readdir
	function should be added

1999-10-22    <braam@wolf.rockies.stelias.com>

	* Beginning of a "rpc_client" layout for OBD

	
1999-10-21    <braam@wolf.rockies.stelias.com>

	* Much of the snap shot client driver is there (see API.txt).
  	This driver introduced the need for substantial changes in the
 	calling interface of the OBD layers. More to come.

	* Part of the RAID1 driver added.  Also here many changes to the
 	calling interface were needed.

	initial attack.
	
	In particular we now have clean tracking of inode counts, so that
	things attach detach cleanly.  Enough there for deliverable 1 & 2.

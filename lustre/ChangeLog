2002-10-01  Phil Schwan  <phil@clusterfs.com>
	* version 0_5_13
	* bug fixes:
	  - locks would be cancelled without throwing away data pages,
	    resulting in inconsistent data (605627)
	  - inode attributes were not always being refreshed (605627, 612449)
	  - lconf now continues to cleanup after lctl reports an error
	  - MDS now enforces user permissions (602707)
	  - lprocfs cleanup fixed, but not yet enabled (614157)
	  - fixed infinite server hang, should a client not respond to an AST
	  - avoid going into recovery if user calls readlink() with a buffer
	    that's too small (613941)
	  - AST RPCs no longer require replies (614867) -- this may be changed
	  - don't crash server if client sends an IOV that's too big (611336)
	  - fixed lock conversion deadlock (611892)
	  - fixed the following of symlinks (614622)
	* recovery: the server can remove locks from a client that dies, other
	  clients can make progress
	* more extN patch fixes

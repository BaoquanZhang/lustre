 sb=n				Use alternate superblock at this location.
 
+iopen				Makes an invisible pseudo-directory called 
+				__iopen__ available in the root directory
+				of the filesystem.  Allows open-by-inode-
+				number.  i.e., inode 3145 can be accessed
+				via /mntpt/__iopen__/3145
+
+iopen_nopriv			This option makes the iopen directory be
+				world-readable.  This may be safer since it
+				allows daemons to run as an unprivileged user,
+				however it significantly changes the security
+				model of a Unix filesystem, since previously
+				all files under a mode 700 directory were not
+				generally avilable even if the
+				permissions on the file itself is
+				world-readable.

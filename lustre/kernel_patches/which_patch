SERIES             VERSION                  COMMENT

SUPPORTED KERNELS:
2.6-suse           SLES9 before SP1         already in SLES9 SP1 kernel
2.6-suse-newer     SLES9: 2.6.5-7.282       extra patches for SLES9 after SP1
2.6-rhel4          RHEL4: 2.6.9-55.EL
2.6-sles10         SLES10: 2.6.16.21-0.8

CLIENT SUPPORT FOR UNPATCHED KERNELS:
                   kernel.org 2.6.16-2.6.19
                   RHEL4: 2.6.9-42.0.8EL

NB - The patches in the 2.6-suse series should already be in the SLES9 SP1
     kernel.  The patches in the 2.6-suse-newer series are patches that
     have been created since the SP1 kernel was released and should be
     applied to the already-patched SP1 kernel.

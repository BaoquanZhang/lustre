SUPPORTED KERNELS:
rhel-2.4.21        RHEL3: 2.4.21-47.0.1.EL
2.6-suse           SLES9 before SP1         already in SLES9 SP1 kernel
2.6-suse-newer     SLES9: 2.6.5-7.282       extra patches for SLES9 after SP1
2.6-rhel4          RHEL4: 2.6.9-42.0.10.EL
2.6.12-vanilla     kernel.org: 2.6.12.6
2.6-sles10         SLES10: 2.6.16.21-0.8

CLIENT SUPPORT FOR UNPATCHED KERNELS:
                   kernel.org 2.6.16-2.6.19
                   RHEL4: 2.6.9-42.0.8EL

NB - The patches in the 2.6-suse series should already be in the SLES9 SP1
     kernel.  The patches in the 2.6-suse-newer series are patches that
     have been created since the SP1 kernel was released and should be
     applied to the already-patched SP1 kernel.

NB - The patches in the ldiskfs series should not be applied to the kernel.
     They are instead applied by the lustre build process to create the
     ldiskfs kernel module instead of modifying the core ext3 code.

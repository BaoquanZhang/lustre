SERIES             MNEMONIC                 COMMENT                     ARCH

SUPPORTED KERNELS:
rhel-2.4.21        linux-2.4.21-20.3EL      RHEL3 2.4.21                all
2.6-suse           linux-2.6-suse           already in SLES9 SP1 kernel all
2.6-suse-newer     linux-2.6-suse           SLES9 SP1 kernel add-ons    all
2.6-rhel4          linux-2.6-rhel4          RHEL4 2.6.9 kernel          all
2.6.12-vanilla     linux-2.6.12.6           kernel.org 2.6.12.6         all

NB - The patches in the 2.6-suse series should already be in the SLES9 SP1
     kernel.  The patches in the 2.6-suse-newer series are patches that
     have been created since the SP1 kernel was released and should be
     applied to the already-patched SP1 kernel.

NB - The patches in the ldiskfs series should not be applied to the kernel.
     They are instead applied by the lustre build process to create the
     ldiskfs kernel module instead of modifying the core ext3 code.

UNSUPPORTED KERNELS; BEING PHASED OUT; MAY BE MISSING CRITICAL BUG FIXES:
hp-pnnl-2.4.20     linux-2.4.20-hp4_pnnl1   same as vanilla but no uml  ia64
vanilla-2.4.24     linux-2.4.24             patch with uml-2.4.24-6     um
